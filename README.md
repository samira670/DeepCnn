Image classification using Pytorch:
This code is an implementation of a deep convolutional neural network (DeepCNN) for image classification using PyTorch. Here's a summary of the code:

Data Preparation:

The code uses a dataset located at '/content/combined_dataset'.
It defines transformations for training and validation/test sets.
The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets.
Model Architecture:

The DeepCNN model is defined with convolutional layers and fully connected layers for classification.
It includes training and validation loops, utilizing CrossEntropyLoss for classification.
The model is trained using the AdamW optimizer and a learning rate scheduler.
K-Fold Cross Validation:

The code performs K-fold cross-validation (K=10 in this case).
For each fold, a DeepCNN model is trained and evaluated separately.
Performance Metrics:

The code tracks various metrics during training and validation, including accuracy, loss, precision, recall, and F1 score.
The metrics are averaged over all folds, and the results are saved.
Results Visualization:

The code saves the results and then computes average metrics over all folds.
It includes a plotting function to visualize the training and validation metrics across epochs.
Plotting:

The final section uses the plotting function to display average metrics over all folds, providing insights into the model's performance during training and validation.
Saving Results:

The code saves the fold-wise results and the average metrics in 'fold_results.pth' for further analysis.
In summary, this code implements a robust image classification pipeline using deep learning techniques, performs K-fold cross-validation, tracks various performance metrics, and visualizes the results.
